== Installation on Windows

You have three options to install the application on Windows:

1. (easiest) **Download the installer from the https://github.com/BiometricsUBB/Biometrics-Studio/releases[releases page] and run it on your system. The installer will download all the necessary dependencies and install the application on your system. You can then run the application by opening the `biometrics-studio` shortcut on your desktop.**

2. (moderate) Follow the https://github.com/BiometricsUBB/Biometrics-Studio?tab=readme-ov-file#development[#Development] section below to install the application on your system.

3. (if you plan to debug or develop the app later) Clone or download the repository and run the installer script via the command line (make sure you are in the root directory of the project):
....
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
....
NOTE: The above command would install dependencies onto your system. Then you can run the application by opening the `.\start.bat` file.

== Development

=== Pre-requisites

First, you need to have https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/[Tauri] installed (v2 at the time of writing)

Then just run the following commands to start the app:

....
pnpm i
pnpm tauri dev
....

=== Adding New Marking Classes (Current as of: 2025-01-30)

. Create a New Class
.. Add the new marking class to the `MarkingClass` enum in `MarkingBase`.
.. Add a new class extending `MarkingBase`:
... Assign the `markingClass` variable.
... Override the necessary methods, especially `isVisible`.
.. Add the new class to the parameter properties of the `updateTemporaryMarking` method in `Markings.ts` for proper updating.

. Add Translations
.. Add the new class to the list of keys in `translation.ts`.
.. Exclude functions from translation by adding an exclusion for their names.
.. Add translations in `locales/lang/object.ts`.

. Create Drawing Logic
.. In `marking.utils.tsx`, add a case for the new class and implement the drawing logic.
... If the logic uses absolute positioning, calculate its `viewportPosition` to ensure it works properly with zoom (based on `MarkingBase.calculateOriginViewportPosition`).

. Create a Handler for Mouse Events
.. Add new 'ClassMarkingHandler' extending 'MarkingHandler'
.. In `markingModePlugin.ts`, add a case for the new class and invoke the created handler

. Add a Cursor Mode Button to the Toolbar
.. In `toolbar.tsx`, add a `ToggleGroupItem` for the new class.
... Browse icons at https://lucide.dev/icons/[LucideIcons].

. Adjust Save Markings to File Logic in `saveMarkingsDataWithDialog.ts`
.. Add properties to `ExportObject.Data.Markings`. Marking class-specific properties should be nullable.
.. Add the new properties to the `getReducedMarkings` function.

. Adjust Load Markings from File Logic in `loadMarkingsDataWithDialog.ts`
.. Add a case and properties to the `inferMarking` function.
. Add shortcut to `useKeyboardShortcuts.tsx`. (optional)
