=== Adding New Marking Types (Current as of: 2024-12-16)
Example of adding https://github.com/BiometricsUBB/Biometrics-Studio/pull/13/commits/a3fcc39ca85326d0b83e4f7265f80f759e98e359[Line Segment Marking Type]

. Create a New Type
.. Add the new marking type to the `MarkingType` enum in `MarkingBase`.
.. Add a new class extending `MarkingBase`:
... Assign the `type` variable.
... Override the necessary methods, especially `isVisible`.
.. Add the new type to the parameter properties of the `updateTemporaryMarking` method in `Markings.ts` for proper updating.

. Add Translations
.. Add the new type to the list of keys in `translation.ts`.
.. Exclude functions from translation by adding an exclusion for their names.
.. Add translations in `locales/lang/object.ts`.

. Create Drawing Logic
.. In `marking.utils.tsx`, add a case for the new type and implement the drawing logic.
... If the logic uses absolute positioning, calculate its `viewportPosition` to ensure it works properly with zoom (based on `MarkingBase.calculateOriginViewportPosition`).

. Create a Handler for Mouse Events
.. In `mousedown.event.ts`, add a case for the new type and implement the logic.

. Add a Cursor Mode Button to the Toolbar
.. In `toolbar.tsx`, add a `ToggleGroupItem` for the new type.
... Browse icons at https://lucide.dev/icons/[LucideIcons].

. Adjust Save Markings to File Logic in `saveMarkingsDataWithDialog.ts`
.. Add properties to `ExportObject.Data.Markings`. Marking type-specific properties should be nullable.
.. Add the new properties to the `getReducedMarkings` function.

. Adjust Load Markings from File Logic in `loadMarkingsDataWithDialog.ts`
.. Add a case and properties to the `inferMarking` function.
